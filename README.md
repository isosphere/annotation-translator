# annotation-translator
A translation utility for book and document annotation metadata.

The intention of this project is to enable bi-directional conversion between book and document annotation formats, as far as that is possible. It will have to be opinionated to do this well, as there are few standards in this area.

As of this writing, the project is focused on getting koreader annotations into a logseq graph. However, my goal is to made this a general tool that enables conversion to and from any supported formats.
